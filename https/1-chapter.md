**How HTTPS Works: Understanding SSL/TLS Encryption**

**1. SSL/TLS Protocols:**
   - **Definition:** HTTPS relies on either the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), to encrypt communications between a user's browser and a website's server.
   - **Asymmetric Encryption:** SSL/TLS utilizes an 'asymmetric' Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system for encryption.

**2. Asymmetric Encryption:**
   - **Key Components:**
      - **Public Key:** A freely distributed key used for encryption. Anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by its corresponding private key.
      - **Private Key:** A closely guarded key that decrypts data encrypted with the public key. It remains securely stored on the web server.
   - **Encryption Process:**
      - Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the private key, and vice versa. This process ensures secure communication between the user's browser and the web server.

**3. Key Ownership:**
   - **Private Key:** Strictly protected and accessible only to the owner (web server).
   - **Public Key:** Distributed to anyone needing to decrypt information encrypted with the private key.

**4. Security Measures:**
   - **Private Key Security:** The private key is safeguarded on the web server, ensuring it remains inaccessible to unauthorized entities.
   - **Public Key Distribution:** The public key is shared openly and is accessible to anyone requiring it for decryption.

**5. Protection of Communication:**
   - **Encryption Assurance:** Information transmitted between the user and the website is encrypted using this asymmetric encryption system.
   - **Security Guarantee:** Even if intercepted, the encrypted data remains secure as decryption requires the private key.

**6. SSL/TLS Evolution:**
   - **Transition from SSL to TLS:** TLS is the more modern and secure successor to SSL. Websites commonly use TLS to establish a secure connection.

In summary, HTTPS employs SSL or TLS protocols to create a secure communication channel. The asymmetric encryption system ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the user and the web server. The private key, kept securely on the server, plays a crucial role in decrypting information encrypted with the corresponding public key, which is distributed for the purpose of decryption.
