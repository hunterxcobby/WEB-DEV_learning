### Monitoring:

**Definition:**
Monitoring, in the context of software and systems, involves observing and recording various metrics to ensure the proper functioning of a system. It's comparable to a hospital's heart monitor, which constantly checks a patient's heartbeat. Similarly, software monitoring watches computer metrics, records them, and triggers alerts if anything unusual occurs that might impact the system's performance.

**Key Points:**
- **Purpose:** The primary purpose of monitoring is to track the health and performance of software systems.
- **Importance:** The saying "You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure" highlights the significance of monitoring in the tech industry.
- **Data-ism:** In the age of data-driven decision-making, monitoring plays a crucial role in understanding and improving software systems.

### Web Stack Monitoring Categories:

#### 1. Application Monitoring:

**Definition:**
Application monitoring involves gathering data about your running software and ensuring that it behaves as expected. It provides insights into how the software is performing and helps identify and address any issues that may arise.

**Key Points:**
- **Focus:** Centers on the behavior and performance of the software application.
- **Metrics:** Tracks various metrics related to application performance, responsiveness, and user interactions.
- **Goal:** Ensure the application functions correctly, efficiently, and meets user expectations.

#### 2. Server Monitoring:

**Definition:**
Server monitoring revolves around collecting data about your virtual or physical server, ensuring that it is not overloaded, and maintaining optimal performance. It monitors key server resources like CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.

**Key Points:**
- **Focus:** Concentrates on the health and load of the server infrastructure.
- **Metrics:** Monitors server resources such as CPU utilization, memory usage, disk space, and network activity.
- **Goal:** Prevents server overload, ensures resource availability, and maintains system stability.

**Summary:**
Monitoring, encompassing both application and server monitoring, is essential for maintaining the health, performance, and reliability of software systems. It provides real-time insights into system behavior, allowing for proactive problem-solving and optimization.
