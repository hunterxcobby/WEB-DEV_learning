**Caveats Analogy: Mail Sorting and Delivery**

To understand the blurred lines between web servers and application servers, consider the analogy of handling mail:

**Traditional Scenario: Clear Roles**
- Imagine a postal office where there are dedicated roles - one team for sorting letters (like a web server processing requests) and another team for delivering packages (akin to an application server managing business logic).
- The sorting team organizes letters based on addresses and sends them to the delivery team. Each team knows its specific tasks.

**Blurred Lines Scenario: New Technology**
- Now, picture a scenario where the sorting team not only categorizes letters but also has the ability to understand and process special instructions written in a new universal language (XML payload).
- With this new capability, the sorting team can do more than sorting; they can perform some tasks that were typically reserved for the delivery team. The line between sorting and delivering becomes blurred.

**Analogy Explanation:**
- In the traditional scenario, there is a clear separation of tasks between sorting and delivering, just like the distinct roles of web servers and application servers.
- In the blurred lines scenario, the sorting team gains additional capabilities (akin to web servers processing XML payloads) that allow them to handle tasks that were traditionally done by the delivery team (application servers).
- Similarly, most application servers come equipped with web server functionality, making them a comprehensive solution. However, like having a separate sorting facility for certain tasks, developers might choose to deploy standalone web servers alongside application servers for specific advantages like performance optimization and flexible configurations.

In essence, the analogy illustrates how technology advancements can introduce new capabilities, blurring the traditional roles of web servers and application servers while offering flexibility in deployment strategies.
