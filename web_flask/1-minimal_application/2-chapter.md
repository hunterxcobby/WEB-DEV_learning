**Application Discovery Behavior:**

- **Shorthand for Naming:** As mentioned, if your Flask application file is named `app.py` or `wsgi.py`, you can skip the `--app` option when running it. This is a convenient shortcut that works in most cases.

- **Development Server:** The built-in development server included in Flask is suitable for testing and getting started quickly. However, it's not recommended for production environments due to security and performance limitations. You'll need to explore deployment options when you're ready to make your application accessible to a wider audience.

- **Accessing Your Application:** Once you run the application using `flask run` (or the equivalent Python command), open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the URL your server specifies). You should see the "Hello, World!" message.

- **Port Conflicts:** If another program is already using port 5000, you'll encounter an error message. Refer to the Flask documentation's "Address already in use" section for guidance on handling this situation.

**Externally Visible Server:**

- **Local Accessibility by Default:** The development server, by default, only makes your application accessible from your own computer. This is a security measure to prevent potential abuse in debugging mode, where arbitrary Python code could be executed.

- **Making it Public (Cautiously):** If you're confident in your security measures and trust the users on your network, you can make the server publicly accessible by adding `--host=0.0.0.0` to the command line. This instructs the operating system to listen on all public IP addresses. **Exercise caution:** Ensure you have proper security measures in place before doing this, especially in production environments.

**Key Points:**

- The development server is meant for testing, not production.
- Consider security implications before making your application publicly accessible.
- Explore deployment options for real-world use.

Remember, these are just basic concepts. Flask offers many features and capabilities for building more complex and robust web applications.
