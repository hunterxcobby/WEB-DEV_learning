Here are some additional points to consider:

**Security:**

* Not only do popular frameworks benefit from large communities finding and reporting vulnerabilities, but many frameworks also have built-in security features like input validation and escape mechanisms to prevent common attacks.
* However, it's important to remember that no framework is completely secure, and developers still need to be aware of security best practices.

**URL Mapping:**

* URL mapping not only clarifies your website structure for search engines but also improves user experience by creating descriptive and memorable URLs.

**Efficiency:**

* Beyond pre-built functions, frameworks often provide tools for code generation, testing, and debugging, further streamlining the development process.

**Cost:**

* While most popular frameworks are open-source and free to use, the cost savings also come from faster development time and reduced maintenance efforts.

**Support:**

* Active communities offer not only troubleshooting and question-answering but also learning resources, tutorials, and best practice sharing.

**Additional benefits:**

* **Scalability:** Frameworks are designed to handle scaling user traffic and application complexity.
* **Consistency:** Well-defined frameworks promote consistent code structure and make collaboration easier.
* **Portability:** Some frameworks offer code reusability across different projects and platforms.

**Remember:**

* Choosing the right framework depends on your project's needs, team skills, and available resources.
* Learning a framework might have an initial learning curve, but the long-term benefits outweigh the investment.
