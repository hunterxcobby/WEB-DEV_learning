Imagine you're building a house:

Without a framework: You'd start from scratch, gathering all the materials (bricks, wood, etc.), figuring out the foundation, walls, roof, and every single detail. This is time-consuming, prone to errors, and requires expertise in all aspects of construction.
With a framework: Think of a pre-built kit designed for specific house types (bungalow, ranch, etc.). It provides the essential structural components (walls, roof trusses) and instructions on how to assemble them. You still need to add windows, doors, and your own personal touches, but the heavy lifting is done.
Web frameworks are similar:

Without a framework: You'd write all the code for handling user interactions, database connections, security, and more, from scratch. This is complex and requires extensive knowledge of web development technologies.
With a framework: It provides the essential building blocks for common web app tasks, like:
Form handling: Capturing user input and validating it (think pre-cut lumber).
Database access: Storing and retrieving data (think plumbing and electrical systems).
Routing: Directing users to the right parts of your app (think pre-defined room layouts).
Security: Protecting your app from vulnerabilities (think built-in safety features).
Benefits of using frameworks:

Faster development: No need to reinvent the wheel, saving you time and effort.
Reduced errors: Proven code reduces the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities.
Reusable components: Leverage community-built modules for common tasks.
Structured code: Easier to maintain and understand for you and other developers.
Now, to the extract provided:

Web applications have evolved: They're more interactive and user-friendly, similar to native apps installed on your device.
Building them requires expertise: The complexity can be daunting.
Web frameworks help: They simplify development by providing the foundation and tools.
Key concepts:

"Software framework": A collection of pre-written code libraries and tools.
"Web application": An interactive program accessed through a web browser.
"Web services": APIs that let apps communicate with each other.
"Web resources": Files (images, text) used in a web app.
"Web APIs": Interfaces for apps to access data and functionality.
Remember:

Choose a framework that suits your project's needs and your programming skills.
Start with simpler frameworks if you're a beginner.
Many resources and tutorials are available online to help you learn.
I hope this explanation, along with the analogy, clarifies web application frameworks for you! Feel free to ask if you have any further questions.
