Let's explore the new structurally based elements introduced in HTML5 for building better page structures.

**Header (`<header>`):**
- Used to identify the top of a page, article, section, or other page segments.
- May include a heading, introductory text, and navigation.
  ```html
  <header>...</header>
  ```

**Navigation (`<nav>`):**
- Identifies a section of major navigational links on a page.
- Reserved for primary navigation sections, like global navigation or a table of contents.
  ```html
  <nav>...</nav>
  ```

**Article (`<article>`):**
- Identifies a section of independent, self-contained content that can be distributed or reused.
- Commonly used for blog posts, articles, and user-submitted content.
  ```html
  <article>...</article>
  ```

**Section (`<section>`):**
- Identifies a thematic grouping of content, usually including a heading.
- Used to break up and provide hierarchy to a page.
  ```html
  <section>...</section>
  ```

**Aside (`<aside>`):**
- Holds content like sidebars, inserts, or brief explanations tangentially related to surrounding content.
- Can appear off to the left or right side of a page but is a block-level element.
  ```html
  <aside>...</aside>
  ```

**Footer (`<footer>`):**
- Identifies the closing or end of a page, article, section, or other segment.
- Typically found at the bottom of its parent, containing relative information.
  ```html
  <footer>...</footer>
  ```

Remember to use these elements according to their semantic meanings. The `<header>` is distinct from the `<head>` and heading elements, and the choice between `<article>`, `<section>`, or `<div>` depends on the content's semantic role.
