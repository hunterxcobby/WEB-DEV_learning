let's delve into cascading properties within individual selectors. In this example:

```css
/* Styles for paragraph elements */
p {
  background: orange;
  background: green;
}
```

Here, we are working with the background property for paragraph elements (`<p>`). Initially, the background color is set to orange, but then, in the same selector, it's overridden with a background color of green.

Due to the cascade, the second declaration takes precedence since it appears after the first one. Consequently, paragraphs will have a green background, as the latter style rule overrules the former.

Understanding how properties cascade within individual selectors is fundamental to managing and controlling the appearance of specific elements in your CSS. However, it's essential to be aware that there are situations, especially involving different selector types and specificity, where the cascade may behave differently. We'll explore those scenarios next.
