Understanding specificity is crucial for managing styles in CSS. Specificity is calculated using three columns: the first counts ID selectors, the second counts class selectors, and the third counts type selectors. The points are not based on a scale of 10; for instance, class selectors have a specificity of 0-1-0, and ID selectors have a specificity of 1-0-0.

In cases of conflict, the selector with higher specificity weight takes precedence. For example, if a paragraph with the id "food" is selected by both a type selector and an ID selector, the ID selector, with its higher specificity weight, will override the type selector.

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<p id="food">...</p>
```

```css
/* CSS */
#food {
  background: green;
}
p {
  background: orange;
}
```

In this example, the paragraph with the ID "food" will have a green background, as the ID selector takes precedence over the type selector, even though it appears later in the cascade.

Understanding specificity and how it interacts with the cascade is crucial for effective CSS styling. As we proceed, we'll explore combining selectors, which not only alters their specificity but also allows for more intentional and targeted styling.
