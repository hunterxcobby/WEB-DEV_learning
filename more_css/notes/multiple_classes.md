Layering styles with multiple classes in CSS allows for modular and reusable styling. HTML elements can have more than one class attribute value, separated by spaces. This enables the application of different styles to elements while keeping specificity weights low.

For example, consider buttons with a shared font size but varying background colors:

**HTML:**
```html
<a class="btn btn-danger">...</a>
<a class="btn btn-success">...</a>
```

**CSS:**
```css
.btn {
  font-size: 16px;
}
.btn-danger {
  background: red;
}
.btn-success {
  background: green;
}
```

In this example, the shared class `.btn` sets a common font size of 16 pixels for both anchor elements. The additional classes, `.btn-danger` and `.btn-success`, layer on specific background colors for individual buttons.



By employing multiple classes, styles can be easily layered onto elements, promoting modular and maintainable code. This approach helps avoid specificity conflicts and supports a clean and efficient styling strategy. As we explore more concepts, this practice will become more intuitive.
