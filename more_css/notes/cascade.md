The cascade in CSS is the mechanism by which styles are applied to elements, and it operates from the top of the style sheet to the bottom. Let's explore this concept further with an example:

```css
/* Styles at the top of the style sheet */
p {
  background: orange;
  font-size: 24px;
}

/* Styles towards the bottom of the style sheet */
p {
  background: green;
}
```

In this example, all paragraph elements (`<p>`) are initially styled with an orange background and a font size of 24 pixels. However, further down the style sheet, the background color for paragraphs is overridden to green.

The cascade determines that the styles declared later in the style sheet take precedence. Consequently, all paragraphs will have a green background, as specified by the latter style rule. It's important to note that the font size remains at 24 pixels because the second paragraph selector did not introduce a new font size.

Understanding the cascade is crucial for managing and controlling styles effectively in your CSS.
