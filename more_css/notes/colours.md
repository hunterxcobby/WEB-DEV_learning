### Keywords
Keywords are simple and intuitive color representations. Common examples include:
- `red`
- `green`
- `blue`
- `black`
- `white`

### Hexadecimal Notation
Hexadecimal notation is widely used in CSS. It represents colors as six hexadecimal digits, where the first two digits represent the red channel, the next two represent green, and the last two represent blue. For instance:
- `#ff0000` (pure red)
- `#00ff00` (pure green)
- `#0000ff` (pure blue)
- `#000000` (black)
- `#ffffff` (white)

### RGB Values
RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values are expressed as `rgb(red, green, blue)`, where each color channel ranges from 0 to 255. Example:
- `rgb(255, 0, 0)` (red)
- `rgb(0, 255, 0)` (green)
- `rgb(0, 0, 255)` (blue)

### HSL Values
HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values use a different approach. Hue is represented as an angle in degrees (0 to 360), saturation is a percentage (0% to 100%), and lightness is also a percentage (0% being black, 100% being white). Example:
- `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)` (red)
- `hsl(120, 100%, 50%)` (green)
- `hsl(240, 100%, 50%)` (blue)

These color representations provide flexibility, and choosing the appropriate one depends on your preference and the requirements of your project. They can be used in various CSS properties like `color`, `background-color`, or `border-color` to style elements with different colors.
