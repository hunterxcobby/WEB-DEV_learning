**Attributes:**
Attributes are like additional information or properties that you can attach to an HTML element. They provide extra details about how the element should behave or appear.

Consider attributes as adjectives describing a noun. If an element is a noun (like a heading or a link), attributes are the adjectives that tell us more about that noun. For example, the "id" attribute identifies an element uniquely, like giving it a name. The "class" attribute classifies an element, grouping it with others that share similar properties.

Attributes are placed within the opening tag, right after the element's name. They usually consist of a name and a value. The format is name="value," enclosed in quotes. For instance, an anchor link `<a>` with an "href" attribute might look like this:

```html
<a href="http://shayhowe.com/">Shay Howe</a>
```

In this example, the "href" attribute is saying, "This link points to the website http://shayhowe.com/."

Understanding attributes is vital because they allow you to customize and enhance the behavior or appearance of HTML elements. As we proceed, we'll use attributes to fine-tune the behavior of our webpage elements.
