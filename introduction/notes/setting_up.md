Let's dissect each part of the HTML document structure step by step.

**Setting Up the HTML Document Structure:**

1. **HTML Document Format:** HTML documents are saved with a .html file extension. Use plain text editors like Dreamweaver or Sublime Text, avoiding rich text editors like Microsoft Word or Pages.

2. **Required Structure:** Every HTML document needs these: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>

>`, and `<body>`.

3. **Document Type Declaration:** `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells browsers the HTML version. In this case, we're using the latest version.

4. **HTML Element:** `<html>` signifies the start of the document.

5. **Head Element:** `<head>` contains metadata about the page, like the document title or links to external files. Content here isn't displayed on the webpage.

6. **Body Element:** `<body>` contains all visible content on the webpage.

**Example HTML Structure:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a web page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here, `<meta charset="utf-8">` sets the character encoding, and `<title>` sets the document title.

**Self-Closing Elements:**
Some elements don't have closing tags; they get content or behavior from attributes. Examples include `<br>`, `<meta>`, and `<img>`.

**Code Validation:**
Validators (like W3C's) check for mistakes in HTML and CSS, ensuring proper rendering and teaching best practices.

Understanding this structure is foundational for creating HTML documents.
