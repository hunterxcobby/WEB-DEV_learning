**Elements:**
Think of HTML elements as the building blocks of your webpage. They define the structure and content of different objects on the page. For example, if your webpage is like a document, elements are the specific components of that document.

Now, consider elements like different tools in a toolbox. You have headings (<h1> through <h6>), which are like different-sized labels for sections. Paragraphs are like neatly written paragraphs in your document (<p> element). Then there are links (<a>), divisions (<div>), spans (<span>), and emphasized text (<strong> and <em>).

Picture each element as a specific tool with its unique purpose. The `<` and `>` angle brackets mark the beginning and end of an element, defining its boundaries. It's like putting each tool back into its designated space in the toolbox. So, when you see something like `<h1>`, it's saying, "Here's a heading tool, and it's of the first level."

Understanding these elements is crucial because they shape the content structure of your webpage. As we proceed, we'll see how to use these tools effectively to craft a well-structured document. Ready to move on to tags and attributes?
