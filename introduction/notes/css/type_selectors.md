**Type Selectors:**
Type selectors target elements based on their HTML tag or element type. They are the most straightforward selectors. For instance, if you want to style all division elements (`<div>`), you use a type selector of `div`.

Here's an example:

**CSS:**
```css
div {
  /* Styles for all division elements */
  ...
}
```

**HTML:**
```html
<div>...</div>
<div>...</div>
```

In this code, the CSS type selector `div` says, "Apply these styles to all division elements." The corresponding HTML shows two `<div>` elements, both affected by the styles specified in the CSS.

Type selectors are handy when you want to style all instances of a particular element type on your webpage.
