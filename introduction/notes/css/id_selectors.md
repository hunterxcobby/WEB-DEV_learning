**ID Selectors:**
ID selectors are the most precise selectors, targeting a unique element based on its id attribute value. Unlike class selectors, id selectors are reserved for one element per page because an id should be unique.

Here's an example:

**CSS:**
```css
#shayhowe {
  /* Styles for the element with the id "shayhowe" */
  ...
}
```

**HTML:**
```html
<div id="shayhowe">...</div>
```

In this example, the CSS id selector `#shayhowe` says, "Apply these styles to the element with the id 'shayhowe'." The corresponding HTML shows a `<div>` element with the id attribute set to "shayhowe."

ID selectors are powerful for styling a specific, significant element on a page. However, remember that an id should only be used once per page to maintain uniqueness.
