**Class Selectors:**
Class selectors allow us to target elements based on their class attribute values. They provide a more specific way to style a particular group of elements rather than all elements of a certain type.

Here's an example:

**CSS:**
```css
.awesome {
  /* Styles for elements with the class "awesome" */
  ...
}
```

**HTML:**
```html
<div class="awesome">...</div>
<p class="awesome">...</p>
```

In this example, the CSS class selector `.awesome` is saying, "Apply these styles to all elements with the class 'awesome'." The corresponding HTML shows both a `<div>` and a `<p>` element, both of which will be styled according to the `.awesome` class.

Class selectors are powerful because they allow you to apply the same styles to different elements by assigning them the same class attribute value.
