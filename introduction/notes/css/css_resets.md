**CSS Resets:**
Web browsers have default styles for various HTML elements, and these styles can vary between browsers. CSS resets are used to standardize the default styles across different browsers, ensuring a consistent starting point for styling.

CSS resets typically involve removing default sizing, margins, paddings, and additional styles applied by browsers, providing a clean slate. It's essential to place the reset at the beginning of your stylesheet so that it takes precedence and establishes a common baseline for all browsers.

Two notable resets are:
1. **Eric Meyer's Reset:** A popular choice that provides a comprehensive reset for common HTML elements.
2. **Normalize.css:** Created by Nicolas Gallagher, it focuses on setting consistent styles for elements rather than a hard reset. It requires a deeper understanding of CSS.

**Cross-Browser Compatibility & Testing:**
Different browsers interpret styles differently, emphasizing the importance of cross-browser compatibility. While it's acceptable for websites to have slight variations across browsers, they should generally look similar.

Decide which browsers you want to support and to what degree. Testing your website in various browsers helps identify and address any rendering discrepancies.
