**Selectors:**
Selectors in CSS are like search queries for HTML elements. They designate which element(s) to style. Selectors can be broad, targeting all instances of a certain type (like `<p>` for paragraphs), or specific, pinpointing elements with a particular attribute value (like an id or class).

Imagine selectors as a spotlight shining on specific elements you want to style. For example, `p` as a selector targets all paragraph elements on a page. If you want to be more specific, you can target elements with a certain id or class.

In CSS, selectors are followed by curly brackets `{}`, where you define the styles to be applied. For instance:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

Here, the selector `p` is saying, "Style all paragraphs on the page." The styles inside the curly brackets then specify the color and font size for those paragraphs.

Understanding selectors is crucial because they allow you to precisely control which elements receive specific styles. Ready to move on to the next CSS term.
