**Values:**
Values in CSS determine the specific behavior or appearance of a property. They are like the instructions you provide for each property, specifying how you want that property to behave.

In your example:
```css
p {
  color: orange;    /* The value for color is set to orange */
  font-size: 16px;  /* The value for font-size is set to 16 pixels */
}
```

Here, `orange` and `16px` are values. They tell the browser that for all paragraphs (`p`), the text color should be orange, and the font size should be 16 pixels.

Values are situated between the colon `:` and the semicolon `;` within a declaration. Each declaration within the curly brackets of a selector defines a property-value pair.

Understanding values is essential because they allow you to fine-tune the details of your styles. With selectors, properties, and values working together, you can precisely control how different elements on your webpage appear.
