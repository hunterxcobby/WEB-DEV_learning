**Additional Selectors:**
While type, class, and ID selectors are fundamental, there are more advanced selectors available. Some additional selectors you might encounter include:

1. **Descendant Selectors:** Styles elements that are descendants of a certain element. For example:
   ```css
   article p {
     /* Styles all paragraphs inside an article */
     ...
   }
   ```

2. **Child Selectors:** Styles direct children of a specified element. For instance:
   ```css
   ul > li {
     /* Styles list items that are direct children of a list */
     ...
   }
   ```

3. **Pseudo-classes:** Selects elements in a specific state. For example:
   ```css
   a:hover {
     /* Styles links when hovered over */
     ...
   }
   ```

4. **Attribute Selectors:** Styles elements based on their attributes. For instance:
   ```css
   input[type="text"] {
     /* Styles text input fields */
     ...
   }
   ```

These selectors provide more nuanced ways to target and style elements, enhancing your ability to create sophisticated designs.

As you become comfortable with the basics, exploring these advanced selectors will give you more control over the styling of your webpages.
