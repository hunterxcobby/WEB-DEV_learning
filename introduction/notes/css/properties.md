**Properties:**
Once you've selected an element with a selector, properties determine the specific styles applied to that element. Properties are like the instructions telling the browser how you want the element to look or behave.

Picture properties as the details you specify for stylingâ€”like choosing the color, size, or background of an element. In CSS, properties are listed within the curly brackets `{}` after the selector, each followed by a colon `:`.

For example:
```css
p {
  color: blue;      /* Set the text color to blue */
  font-size: 16px;  /* Set the font size to 16 pixels */
}
```

Here, `color` and `font-size` are properties. They're saying, "For all paragraphs (`p`), make the text blue and set the font size to 16 pixels."

As you work more with CSS, you'll encounter various properties to control different aspects of styling. Understanding properties is key to crafting the visual presentation of your webpage.
