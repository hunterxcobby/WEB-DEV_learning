In the context of HTML and CSS, a "class" is a way to categorize and group HTML elements together so that they can share the same styles or behavior. It's an attribute that you can apply to HTML elements to give them a common identity.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Class Attribute:** In HTML, you can add a `class` attribute to an element, and this attribute is assigned a value, which serves as the class name. For example:
   ```html
   <div class="my-class">This is a div with a class.</div>
   <p class="my-class">This is a paragraph with the same class.</p>
   ```

2. **CSS Class Selector:** In CSS, you use a period (.) followed by the class name to create a class selector. This allows you to define styles that will be applied to all elements with that class. For example:
   ```css
   .my-class {
     color: blue;
     font-size: 16px;
   }
   ```

   Here, any element with the class "my-class" will have blue text and a font size of 16 pixels.

Classes are beneficial because they provide a way to apply consistent styles or behavior to multiple elements across your webpage without having to duplicate the style definitions for each individual element. They contribute to the modular and maintainable design of your web pages.
