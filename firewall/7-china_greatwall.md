**National Firewalls and the Great Firewall of China**

Beyond safeguarding internet sessions and sensitive data, firewalls play a role in controlling access to information, especially in nations with restrictive policies. The most prominent example is China's "Great Firewall," a nationwide system managed by government IT personnel.

Key aspects of the Great Firewall:

1. **IP Address Blocking:**
   - The firewall employs IP address blocking to restrict access to websites or content not approved by the government.

2. **DNS Cache Poisoning:**
   - Utilizes DNS cache poisoning to redirect IP requests, ensuring that attempts to access blocked sites or keywords are rerouted.

3. **VPN Restrictions:**
   - Many VPN providers are blocked in China, limiting citizens to government-approved VPNs. This control hinders flexibility in internet usage.

4. **Content Monitoring:**
   - Enables the government to closely monitor and manage the content accessible to its citizens, exerting control over the information flow.

The Great Firewall represents an extensive and sophisticated approach to internet censorship, illustrating the government's ability to regulate online content, shape narratives, and limit access to information deemed sensitive or undesirable.
